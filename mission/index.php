					<p>It gradually dawned on me that none of the online services I used on a near-daily basis reflected me as a person. I was a gypsy wandering in an increasingly fractured internet, presenting facets of myself on various platforms I did not make or control. I knew I could not rent the space I needed; I had to build it.</p>
					<p>Welcome to Peterscene, my online residence, workplace, and showcase for all the varied things I do. I keep a simple and clean space here. Rest your weary eyes. Stay as long as you like!</p>
